      An e-commerce website is an online platform that allows businesses and individuals to buy and sell goods or services over the internet. It serves as a virtual storefront where customers can browse product listings, view images and descriptions, compare prices, and make purchases through secure payment gateways. E-commerce websites often include features such as shopping carts, user accounts, order tracking, and customer reviews to enhance the shopping experience. They offer convenience by enabling shopping from anywhere at any time and are widely used by retailers, wholesalers, and service providers across various industries. Popular examples include Amazon, Flipkart, and Shopify-based stores.
